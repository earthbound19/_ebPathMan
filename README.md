# _ebPathMan

## DESCRIPTION
Toolset to simplify Windows and 'nixy PATH management.

## INSTALLATION AND USAGE
Clone this repo and open a terminal to the path you have cloned it into, and examine the comments in and, if you think it's a good idea, run _setBinPaths.bat.

For now (if not always), refer to comments in that and other scripts in this repo.

PathEditor.exe is handy-dandy. It has a GUI. Double-click the program and you'll see. I didn't create this tool.

## TO DO
Document this toolset more clearly.
